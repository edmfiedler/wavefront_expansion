# Wavefront Expansion Algorithm

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_expansion_algorithm

The idea is that a wave is generated from the goal to the start.
The expansion of this wave will find the shortest path to the goal.

This wavefront algorithm generates a script in the command window that can be copy-pasted as an SMR-CL script.
Various shapes are provided, to make new ones, the map would have to be changed accordingly.
